🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
Data Science & Machine Learning Project | Python | Kaggle Dataset

🔍 Project Summary
Embarked on a data-driven journey to explore and predict survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic. Using Python and powerful machine learning tools, I built a predictive model that identifies key patterns and delivers insights rooted in history. This project demonstrates end-to-end data science skills—from cleaning and visualizing data to training and evaluating predictive models.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Techniques: Classification Models, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning, EDA

Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors

📊 Process Breakdown
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized key survival trends based on gender, class, age, and embarkation port

Identified correlations and missing values using heatmaps and summary statistics

2. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Imputed missing values (e.g., age, embarked)

Created meaningful features like FamilySize, IsAlone, and Title extracted from names

Encoded categorical data for modeling

3. Model Development & Evaluation
Trained multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and KNN

Performed cross-validation and compared accuracy, precision, and recall

Selected the best model with ~82% accuracy on the test set

🧠 Key Insights
Women and children in higher classes had the highest survival probabilities

Traveling alone and lower ticket class significantly decreased survival likelihood

Feature engineering significantly boosted model performance

🚀 What I Learned
The power of storytelling through data

How to handle real-world data imperfections

How domain knowledge and creative features can improve prediction quality

Model evaluation is as important as model accuracy
